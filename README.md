# IND708-Group-Project
Logistic Regression and SVM  
Unzip Data folder   
Traffic_Collisions.csv file is located there   
To run logistic regression and SVM collab file - upload Traffic_Collisions.csv inside Collab content folder    
Run the code    

KNN and Naive Bayes   
Download KNN and Naive Bayes zipped folder and unzip    
Upload the appropriate csv for which collision you want to run and run the code    

Random Forest     
1. Unzip the random forest folder and Download Traffic_Collisions_2018-2022_Random_Forest  CSV file   
2. Open IND_708_Project_Random_Forest.ipynb file in collab   
3. After pressing run, press "Choose files" from prompt and select the "Traffic_Collisions_2018-2022_Random_Forest" file   
4. The default collision being predicted is Injury collisions, to predict a different collision remove line 50 and change it to:   
For Property Damage collisions use:  y = df['PD_Collisions']   
For Fail to remain collision use:    y = df['FTR_Collisions']
